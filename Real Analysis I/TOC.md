Real Analysis I
===============

In this course we deal with construction of the set of real numbers and functions of a real variable in n-space.
In particular, we deal with analytic properties of real functions and sequences, such as:
convergence and limits of sequences of real numbers, the calculus of the real numbers, and continuity, smoothness and related properties.
